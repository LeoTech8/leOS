# leOS
*The name is a combination of Leo and OS*
## What's New?
OS loads into 32bit protected mode with filesystem, loads kernel and displays text!
## How to compile?
*All compile instructions are for Linux/Macos*
If it is your first time compiling, run sudo chmod +x compileos.sh, this will give privelages to run. To compile run ./compileos.sh. 
This requires NASM, x86_64-elf-gcc (x86_64-elf-ld is part of x86_64-elf-gcc) and QEMU. These can be found through apt or Homebrew.
## Why so basic?
Yes. It's basic (*For now*) I will be regularly adding updates!
